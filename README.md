Stock Market Prediction
Overview :
This project is a comprehensive system for predicting stock market prices using machine learning techniques. It leverages historical data to forecast future stock trends and provides visual insights through charts and diagrams. The project aims to assist investors and analysts in making informed decisions by predicting stock prices based on patterns and trends.

**Features**
**Data Collection**: Collects historical stock market data (open, high, low, close prices, and volume) from sources such as Yahoo Finance or Alpha Vantage.
**Data Preprocessing**: Cleans and prepares data by handling missing values, normalizing, and splitting the data into training and testing sets.
**Machine Learning Model**: Implements models such as Linear Regression, Decision Tree, or LSTM (Long Short-Term Memory) to predict stock prices.
**Prediction**: Generates future price predictions based on the trained model.
**Visualization**: Displays the actual vs. predicted stock prices on a line chart for easy comparison and analysis.
Performance Evaluation: Evaluates the model's accuracy using metrics like Mean Squared Error (MSE) and Root Mean Squared Error (RMSE).
**Requirements**
Python 3.x
Pandas
NumPy
Matplotlib
Scikit-learn
TensorFlow (optional, for LSTM models)
Alpha Vantage API key (for stock data)
